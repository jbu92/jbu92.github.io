##Wat
So I reckon that the time has come for me to write some of the standard full disclosure stuff alongside your standard disclaimers if I intend to write anything else on here.

While we're here I figure I'll try to scope out what I intend to write about- essentially whatever I happen to feel like jotting down. It will likely be primarily technically-focussed write-ups on random crap I figure out while messing with things that I'm trying to set up or configure or code or whatever, but may include random personal blog items from time to time.

##Whois
As of 2015, I am a Security Analyst with Dell SecureWorks. Prior to that, I was a student in RIT's information security and forensics program (which has since been renamed to a less interesting title).

My passions have always boiled down to technology and education, which I think boils down to being driven to learn and understand all that I can. This passion led me down a fairly straightforward path to pursue a career in information security.

##Standards
I do not speak for my employer. Any and all original research represented by the writings present on this site is/was/shall be conducted on my own time and on my own dime, and any exceptions to this shall be appropriately identified.
