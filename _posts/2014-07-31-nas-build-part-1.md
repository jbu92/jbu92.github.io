## Introduction
For various reasons, I decided to move away from my current storage setup to a new NAS machine. Because I want to have at least *something* on this site, I decided to make a post about it.
My initial setup, which I have been using for ~2 years, is a mid-sized tower machine running Windows 7 with a 500GB system disk, and a 2TB and a 3TB disk for data. The 500GB disk is likely to fail soon, which is among my primary motivators for this migration.
My goals for this build were to have something in a smaller form factor, running Linux (less overhead- both in processing resources and disk space), and with more of an upgrade path than my previous setup (i.e. USB3 capabilities for the future).

## Parts
* Two existing 3.5" HDDs
* Motherboard: [Gigabyte GA-J1800N-D2H](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00IFE4VF8/ "Amazon link") (because it was on sale for like $55)
* Case: [Cooler Master Elite 130](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00DRA4F06/ "Amazon link") - $50
* Power Supply: [Corsair CX430M](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00ALYORA4/ "Amazon link") - $50
* RAM: Crucial [8GB stick](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00ALYORA4/ "Amazon link") - $78

## Assembly
I'm not going to go through how to put together a computer. It's fairly straightforward, and there's a billion-and-one tutorials already out there. The interesting part of this story is the software, which due to current circumstances I'm postponing for another post.
Anyways, I guess now is as good a time as any to air some grievances, and talk about a few caveats-
* Many people have groaned about the quality control on the Cooler Master Elite 130, especially the mount points for the standoffs
* My issue was that all of the screws were **very** tight in their holes
   * In the interest of fairness- after being put in and taken out a few times, most of them loosened up to a reasonable level
* The motherboard I purchased only has two SATA slots. If you intend to use a lot of drives, use a different motherboard. I purchased the Gigabyte because it was on sale and I only plan on using two drives for now anyways.
* Similarly, the case that I selected can only hold a few drives.

There's plenty of selection out there for motherboards and cases. These selections fit my needs well enough, and being on a budget, well enough was sufficient.

I'll probably update this post with pictures of my finished build, but really the idea of this post is to just get something up here and test layouts and whatnot. Part 2 is currently planned to be software installation and configuration.
